# C++ Programming 1
This repository holds my assignments for C++ programming 1, which include the following projects:

## Elevator
Unlike the others in the repo this assignment was coded in C instead of C++, and helped me to get acquainted with the ways in which those languages are different from C#. Core concepts covered in this project are memory allocation and linked list.

## Battleship
The first script randomly places battleship pieces on a grid while following certain specifications (for example, ships cannot be within 3 spaces of each other). If the user inputs a board size that is too small for the specifications to be possible, it prompts them to enter a larger one. The second script contains logic for an AI to play Battleship against the user, deducing its next move depending on the outcome of its previous one.

## Blackjack
An application that simulates a hundred rounds of Blackjack between a single player and a dealer. Each round has randomly generated hands and draws, and the player will decide to hit or stand depending on its current total. The amount of times the simulated player and dealer won is displayed at the end of the program.

## Coffee Maker
This project focused on object-oriented programming in C++, and is a text-based simulator for making coffee with a bean hopper and resevoir.
